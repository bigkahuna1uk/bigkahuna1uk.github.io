= Clojure X 2015

https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6861-clojure-exchange-2015[Clojure exChange 2015] has just finished and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The feature packed two days of the conference has passed by in a blur.  I've been to other IT conferences before but this was my first one entirely devoted to Clojure.  It was a great forum to meet kindred spirits as well as the added bonus of meeting some of the authors of open-sourced Clojure projects.

It was also gratifying that as well as the comprehensive and growing Clojure ecosystem, one could witness also the large number of real world applications written in Clojure. This is a testament to Clojure's burgeoning maturity as a programming language.

I'm pleased to announce the majority of talks are already available on Skillsmatter's website.
