I have been a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development[BDD] practitioner for a few years, a combination of self-learning and attending various user groups and getting useful feedback from my peers.  BDD is something you pick up gradually and gets better with practice. My personal experience when starting to use BDD was that it can be a form of information overload because one is not sure where to start. With newcomers, sometimes the focus is on the tools rather than the extracting and understand the actual behaviour of the business. Some people think they've practised BDD if they just write scenarios and automate their examples, a tick box exercise. But BDD is and should be larger than that.

I was fortunate to be asked to peer review a set of online training videos from the https://cucumber.io/school[Cucumber School], the team who originally created Cucumber. The course assumes no prior knowledge in BDD concepts or the use of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)[Cucumber]. Every video has a range of exercises that you can perform after watching to reinforce your learning.  This is great as it means that the videos are not a dry exercise in memory retention but rather an impetus for self-learning.

I was gratified to see that the initial lesson were geared towards fleshing out behaviour via conversations or examples rather than diving straight into the tool. This is achieved by the need for distinct user roles in defining and refining those examples.
